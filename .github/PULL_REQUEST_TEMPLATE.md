## Summary

Describe the change and why it is needed.

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests added/updated where relevant
- [ ] Existing tests pass locally
- [ ] Typecheck/build pass locally

## Security and Auth Impact

- [ ] I reviewed auth, authorization, and data-access impact
- [ ] I reviewed input validation and unsafe trust boundaries

## Third-Party Provenance and Licensing

- [ ] This PR does not copy external code line-for-line
- [ ] If external code was copied or substantially adapted, I added/updated `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
- [ ] I verified the upstream license permits this reuse and preserved required notices
- [ ] I included source repo/path/commit details in the PR description for any reused code
